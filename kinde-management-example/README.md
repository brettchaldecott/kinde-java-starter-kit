# Kinde-Management-Example

This project demonstrates how to use the Kinde-Management library, which wraps the OpenAPI to facilitate managing a Kinde domain. The example covers operations such as managing users, applications, roles, and other administrative tasks within your Kinde domain.

## Setup

To configure the unit tests, you need to set up a `.env` file, located at the root of this project. This file contains the necessary environment variables required for the tests to run successfully.

### Required Environment Variables:

```shell
KINDE_DOMAIN=https://< replace >.kinde.com
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=< replace >
KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=< replace >
KINDE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/kinde-j2ee-app/login
KINDE_GRANT_TYPE=CODE
KINDE_SCOPES=openid
KINDE_AUDIENCE=https://< replace >.kinde.com/api
```

#### Explanation of Each Variable:
- **KINDE_DOMAIN**: Replace `< replace >` with your specific Kinde domain (e.g., `myapp.kinde.com`).
- **KINDE_CLIENT_ID**: Replace `< replace >` with your application's client ID, obtainable from the Kinde dashboard.
- **KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET**: Replace `< replace >` with your application's client secret, also available from the Kinde dashboard.
- **KINDE_REDIRECT_URI**: Replace `< replace >` with the appropriate URI, where Kinde will redirect the user after authentication. This is typically set to `http://localhost:8080/kinde-j2ee-app/login` during testing.
- **KINDE_GRANT_TYPE**: This should be set to `CODE`, indicating that the application will use the Authorization Code Grant flow.
- **KINDE_SCOPES**: Typically set to `openid` to request an ID token from the identity provider.
- **KINDE_AUDIENCE**: Replace `< replace >` with the URL of the API endpoint exposed for your domain. This variable tells Kinde to grant access to the specified API for your client.

Make sure to replace the placeholder values (`< replace >`) with your specific configuration details before running the tests.

## Execution

You can execute the unit tests either through your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or by using Maven from the command line.

### Running Tests with Maven:

To run the tests using Maven, use the following command:

```shell
mvn -Dtest=KindeManagementExampleTest test
```

This command will execute the KindeManagementExampleTest class, running all the tests defined within it. Ensure you run this command from the project's root directory.
